# EduxRepoSimpleCodeCopy

### Note this is a very very simple project that is a baseline for the actual project. 

We based on this to build the rest of the app but unfortunately we were unable to deploy these project. However this project was later transitioned to react native to support iOS devices as well.

This is just the skeletal frame that is used as a basis for the build. It does not include the Edux API, the user dependent UI and Video tutorial management for the students.
